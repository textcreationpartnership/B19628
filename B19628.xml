            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Kings most excellent Majesty, by His Proclamation dated the Nineteenth day of <hi>November, 1661.</hi> in the Thirteenth year of His Majesties Reign (amongst other matters therein contained for the better discovery of any Imbezlements of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Stores and Provisions of War, and to the end the Receivers of such Stoln Goods might not pretend ignorance) was pleased to Command, Publish and Declare, That all the Ropemakers who should thereafter work in His Majesties Yards, or should elsewhere make any sort of Cordage for the use of His Majesties Navy, should make the same in manner following <hi>(viz.)</hi> All Cables, Hawsers, and other Cordage of the larger sort, should be wrought with one small hair-line through every strand thereof; all Coyls of smaller Cordage should have two strands composed of even threads, and the other should have one odd thread: As also, that on all other Stores, where it may be done without prejudice to the said Stores, or charge to His Majesty, as Nails, Spikes, and other the like Stores, that the Broad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row should be put on some part of the same, whether by Stamp, Brand, or other way, as should be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly directed by the principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesties Navy, to whom the care thereof was committed. And whereas since the publishing of His Majesties said Proclamation, it appears by experience, that the way of making Cordage as before appointed, is not only chargeable to His Majesty, but also inconvenient in the working of the Cordage; and that way of marking the Nails and Spikes doth not fully answer the end to which the same were intended; His Majesty thereof is pleased further hereby to Command, Publish and Declare, That from henceforward all the Ropemakers who shall work in His Majesties Yards, or shall elsewhere make any sort of Cordage for the use of His Majesties Navy, shall make the same as is hereafter mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Cordage of three Inches and upwards, shall (instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought with one small hair-line through every strand thereof, as afore ordered) be wrought with a white thread laid the contrary way, and the smaller Cordage, <hi>viz.</hi> from three Inches downwards shall (instead of having two strands composed of even threads, and the third to have one odd thread as was before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) be wrought with a twyne in lieu of a white thread to be laid the contrary ways, as aforesaid. And His Majesty doth further Command, That all the Nails and Spikes which shall hereafter be made for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties use (besides the Broad Arrow appointed to be set on them as aforesaid) shall be wrought on the heads with five stroaks, <hi>viz.</hi> four on the sides, as is accustomary, and one larger then the rest on the top thereof. And His Majesty doth hereby forbid all Artificers or Workmen whatever to make any Cordage, Nails, or Spikes so marked, except for the use of His Majesties Navy: And doth likewise hereby Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all His Majesties loving Subjects, That they forbear to buy or receive from any person whatsoever, any Cordage, Spikes, or Nails marked as aforesaid, without particular order and leave from the principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesties Navy, upon pain of being proceeded against as Receivers of Stoln Goods, and as Imbezlers of His Majesties Stores. And for the better and more certain publishing the Marks of the Spikes and Nails, as aforesaid, His Majesty doth hereby enjoyn the principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesties Navy, with all convenient speed to cause Patterns of them to be sent to Shipwrights and Ironmongers-Hall respectively, there to remain for the Information of such as are concerned in the knowledge thereof. And it is His Majesties will and pleasure further to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Declare, That His Majesties aforementioned Proclamation of the Nineteenth of <hi>November, 1661.</hi> shall, as to all other matters and things therein contained, excepting what is hereby thought fit to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, stand and abide in full force and vertue to all intents and purposes.</p>
